The database used to store data for the Quiz webpage using SQLite.

## Checklist
* [x] **Make a database**
* [x] **Write some functions to connect to database**

## Important notes 
### .jar support
- compile Main.java with `javac` and use `java -cp .:sqlite-jdbc-3.30.1.jar Main` to run.
- unfortunately `-cp .:sqlite-jdbc-3.30.1.jar` is needed as a sqlite library in jar format, unless the IDE you use can implement the library. 
- **EDIT:** sqlite-jar support has been added with gradle, this should simplify things.

Known IDEs with support:  
1.  [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-project#_working-with-jar-files) 
(VSCodium - open source version of VSCode - should have support, not working at my end however)
3.  [**IntelliJ**](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/library.html#define-library)
