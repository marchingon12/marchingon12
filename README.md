# Howdy, it's Austin! ðŸ¤™

## Who I Am

Hi, I'm a German bachelor student learning computer science in Germany. I first learned programming from other people online, exploring the vast majority of Android Custom ROMs, creating basic Android applications and joining the open-source community. I'm planning on using GitHub more often as my studies prolong.

## What I'm Doing

I've just finished learning the C and Java courses in my studies and plan to further improve in those programming languages. Currently, I'm experimenting with Telegram Bots and further developing my knowledge on Bash as well as Markdown.

Also, I've started writing a blog about things I've done or found worthy to write of in my free time. Check it out by clicking on the badges below! 

## What I've Learned

- **Languages learnt: C, Java, SQLite, Markdown**
 
- **Currently learning: Bash, HTML, Python :snake:**
